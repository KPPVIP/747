Instructions:

1. Place the "747fire" folder into [Gamefolder]\update\X64\dlcpacks\
2. With OpenIV, open [Game folder]\update\update.rpf\common\data\dlclist.xml and add this with Notepad++
		<Item>dlcpacks:\747fire\</Item>

4. Now you are done, you will need a trainer with "spawn by name" function (Enchanted Native Trainer for example) to spawn the vehicle type in:

"747fire"


If the game crashes on startup, use a custom gameconfig.xml (https://www.gta5-mods.com/misc/gta-5-gameconfig-300-cars)



I would advise using a Mods folder (more info at OpenIV) 
and make a backup, I take no responsibility if any shit happens.
